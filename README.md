Purpose: To explore the implementation of two AI Models, Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Networks, and compare their performance as tools in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

Materials and methods: The data used in this study was retrieved from the Wisconsin breast cancer data set from the University of California at Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository, uploaded from the Scikit- Learn Library. Once trained and tested, with attention to overfitting issues, both models were evaluated using four performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall and AUC.

Results: ANN outperformed Logistic Regression regarding accuracy, scoring 0.964. Logistic Regression outperformed ANNs in terms of AUC values, scoring 0.990. Precision and recall within each model presented a slight variation and, when compared, LR outperformed ANN regarding recall, but scored a lower precision.

Conclusion: Based on the obtained performance evaluations, both models proved to be efficient diagnostic tools—the numerical difference between the executed metrics was trivial.
